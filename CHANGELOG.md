# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-03

### Deprecated

- `generatePath` is now deprecated on the main route object.  
  (Itâ€™s still available for backwards compatibility, but will be removed in a future major release.)

### Added

- `generatePath` is now exported directly, so it can be imported and used where needed.
